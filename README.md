 # Aggregations : 
 
      --> It is a way of processing a large number of documents in a collection by means of passing them through different stages.
      
      --> The stages make up is known as pipelines

      --> The stage in pipeline can  filter, sort, group, reshape, and modify documents that pass through the pipelines.
